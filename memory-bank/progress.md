# XPrivacyLua Progress

## What Works

XPrivacyLua successfully implements a comprehensive set of privacy protections for Android 6.0 and later. The following features are fully functional:

1. **Core Privacy Restrictions**: All the restrictions listed in the README are implemented and working:
   - Determine activity (fake unknown activity)
   - Get applications (hide installed apps and widgets)
   - Get calendars (hide calendars)
   - Get call log (hide call log)
   - Get contacts (hide contacts with pro option to allow starred/non-starred contacts)
   - Get location (fake location, hide NMEA messages)
   - Get messages (hide MMS, SMS, SIM, voicemail)
   - Get sensors (hide all available sensors)
   - Read account name (fake name)
   - Read clipboard (fake paste)
   - Read identifiers (fake build serial number, Android ID, advertising ID, GSF ID)
   - Read notifications (fake status bar notifications)
   - Read network data (hide cell info, Wi-Fi networks, fake Wi-Fi network name)
   - Read sync data (hide sync data)
   - Read telephony data (fake IMEI, MEI, SIM serial number, voicemail number, etc.)
   - Record audio (prevent recording)
   - Record video (prevent recording)
   - Send messages (prevent sending MMS, SMS, data)
   - Use analytics (block various analytics services)
   - Use camera (fake camera not available and/or hide cameras)
   - Use tracking (fake user agent, Build properties, network/SIM country/operator)

2. **Extensibility System**: The custom hook definition system works as designed, allowing users to:
   - Create new hook definitions
   - Edit existing hook definitions
   - Share hook definitions through the repository
   - Apply hook definitions at runtime without rebooting (except for persistent system apps)

3. **Pro Features**: The pro companion app successfully provides additional features:
   - Backup and restore of restrictions and settings
   - Selective contacts filtering (allow starred/non-starred)
   - Import/export functionality
   - Custom settings for hook definitions
   - Access to the hook definition repository

4. **Multi-user Support**: The module correctly handles multiple user profiles on a device.

5. **Xposed Integration**: The module integrates properly with Xposed, LSPosed, and EdXposed frameworks.

6. **REST API**: A local REST API that allows other apps to programmatically control XPrivacyLua's privacy settings:
   - Authentication via API key
   - Permission-based access control
   - Ability to get/set restrictions for specific apps
   - Ability to set fake locations for specific apps
   - Comprehensive endpoint documentation

## What's Left to Build

Since the project is no longer supported, there are no official plans for new features. However, if development were to continue, potential areas for improvement include:

1. **REST API Enhancements**:
   - Add more endpoints for additional functionality
   - Implement batch operations for efficiency
   - Add WebSocket support for real-time notifications
   - Create client libraries for common programming languages

2. **Support for Newer Android Versions**: Update the module to support Android 13 and beyond.

3. **Additional Restrictions**: Develop new restrictions for emerging privacy concerns.

4. **Enhanced UI**: Modernize the user interface and improve usability.

5. **Performance Optimizations**: Improve the performance of hook execution and reduce resource usage.

5. **Better Error Handling**: Enhance error reporting and recovery mechanisms.

6. **Expanded Pro Features**: Develop additional pro features to provide more value.

7. **Integration with Other Privacy Tools**: Create integrations with complementary privacy tools.

## Current Status

The project is currently being enhanced with the new REST API feature, though the core functionality remains in a **maintenance-only state**. The README still states: "This project is not supported anymore," but we are adding this specific feature to enable integration with other privacy tools.

Current status:
- The module works on supported Android versions (6.0 to 12)
- The codebase is stable and well-structured
- The documentation is comprehensive
- The hook definition system allows for user extensions
- The REST API is being implemented and tested

The project remains valuable as:
- A functional privacy tool for supported Android versions
- A reference implementation for similar projects
- A learning resource for Xposed module development
- A foundation for potential forks or successor projects

## Known Issues

Several known issues are documented in the README and other project files:

1. **Activity Recognition Restriction**: Hooking `com.google.android.gms.location.ActivityRecognitionResult.extractResult` is known to fail with `java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.google.android.gms.location.DetectedActivity` and `attempt to call nil` for some apps like Google Maps and Netflix.

2. **Camera App Limitations**: The module cannot restrict when apps start the camera app to take pictures, as this is a separate app being launched.

3. **Native Audio Recording**: Cannot prevent apps from using OpenSL ES for Android to record audio (e.g., WhatsApp) because Xposed cannot hook into native code.

4. **Get Applications Restriction**: The restriction will not restrict getting information about individual apps for stability and performance reasons.

5. **IMEI Limitation**: While the telephony data restriction will result in apps seeing a fake IMEI, this doesn't change the actual IMEI address of the device.

6. **Emulator Support**: XPrivacyLua is not supported on emulators, only on physical smartphones and tablets.

7. **Obfuscated Code**: Tracking restrictions only work if the code of the target app was not obfuscated.

8. **Root Apps**: Apps with root access can bypass XPrivacyLua's restrictions.

## Testing Status

While there's no explicit information about test coverage, the project appears to have been thoroughly tested on various devices and Android versions. The known issues section suggests that edge cases have been identified and documented.

## Documentation Status

The project documentation is comprehensive and includes:
- Detailed README with features, restrictions, and installation instructions
- FAQ addressing common questions and issues
- DEFINE.md explaining how to create custom hook definitions
- XPRIVACY.md comparing XPrivacyLua with the original XPrivacy
- Example hook definitions in the examples directory
- Hook definitions in the repo directory

## Community Status

While the project is no longer supported, it still has a community presence:
- XDA forum thread for support: https://forum.xda-developers.com/xposed/modules/xprivacylua6-0-android-privacy-manager-t3730663
- Crowdin project for translations: https://crowdin.com/project/xprivacylua/

## REST API Status

The REST API feature is currently being implemented with the following components:

1. **Core API Server**: The lightweight HTTP server running on localhost is functional.

2. **Authentication System**: API key authentication is implemented and working.

3. **Permission System**: Custom permission verification is implemented.

4. **Basic Endpoints**: The following endpoints are implemented and tested:
   - Get all restrictions
   - Get app restrictions
   - Set app restriction
   - Set location
   - Get location
   - Reset location
   - Get all apps
   - Get app details

5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive API documentation is available in [restapi.md](restapi.md).

6. **Testing**: The API has been tested with various client applications and tools.

7. **Security**: Security measures have been implemented and tested.

The REST API provides a foundation for building an ecosystem of privacy-focused apps that can leverage XPrivacyLua's capabilities programmatically.
